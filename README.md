# So what is this about?

We've created a website to help you plan your trip to another planet. Using CSS, we have a representation of the solar system with working planets. When you click on a planet, you get a picture and detailed information about it. Including how many moons and it's gravity. A user would fill out the form, and then can look at all the trips that have ever been planned.

We are using the Solar System OpenData API for all planetary information.

Ben was the visionary with the idea and created the planets as well as their orbits around the sun using CSS. Tracy created our color scheme for our materialize cards and handled most of the sequelize. Johnny worked on the API for planetary information, the switch for pictures of each planet, routing, and some front end code along with Tracy and Ben. Together, we all touched different aspects outside of our assigned roles in order to help each other.
